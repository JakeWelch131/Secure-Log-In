# Node Application Setup Guide  

Follow these steps to download and run the Node.js application:  

## Prerequisites  
- Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.  
  - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if you haven’t already.  

## Installation Steps  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   - Download the project folder from GitHub:  
     ```bash  
     git clone <repository_url>  
     ```  

2. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**  
   - Move into the backend folder of the project:  
     ```bash  
     cd <project_folder>/backend  
     ```  

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   - Install the necessary npm packages:  
     ```bash  
     npm install  
     ```  

4. **Start the Application**  
   - Run the application:  
     ```bash  
     node app.js  
     ```  

5. **Access the Application**  
   - Open your browser and go to:  
     ```
     http://localhost:3000  
     ```  

You should now see the application running in your browser!

**Note:**  
If the application doesn’t start, ensure that the `app.js` file is present and configured correctly. Also, check if port 3000 is free or modify it in the code if needed.
